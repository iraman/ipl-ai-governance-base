# Validate chat override skill

Use when implementing or reviewing the Shuttle chat booking path or the urgent override of the no-show block in Trimble WorkRide.

Base booking rules (cutoffs, cancel window, no-show block, one booking per date) belong to `validate-booking-rules`. This skill owns only the chat exception from `prd/workride-chat-prd.md`.

## When to use

- Adding or changing `POST /api/chat/bookings` in `backend/server.js`
- Editing `validateUrgentOverride()` or `URGENT_CATEGORIES` in `backend/rules.js`
- Modifying the Shuttle chat widget in `frontend/src/pages/Chat.jsx` or `createChatBooking` in `frontend/src/api.js`
- Changing override fields on bookings in `backend/store.js`

## Procedure

1. Read `prd/workride-chat-prd.md`, `backend/rules.js`, and the no-show section of `.ai-governance/rules/booking-policies.md`.
2. Confirm the exception is chat only: `POST /api/bookings` still returns 403 for a blocked employee, even when the body includes an urgent reason.
3. Confirm `validateUrgentOverride()` accepts only `medical_emergency`, `family_emergency`, or `client_visit`, with a trimmed explanation of 15–500 characters.
4. Confirm a blocked chat request without a valid reason returns 403 with the reason string from `validateUrgentOverride()`.
5. Confirm an accepted override stores `override_category`, `override_explanation`, and `override_source: "chat"`, and does not clear `blocked_until`.
6. Confirm the override does not skip base rules: `isBookableDate()`, the cutoff, and one booking per date still apply on the chat path.
7. Confirm a chat request from an employee who is not blocked books without asking for a reason.
8. Confirm manipulation attempts are refused: admin claims, `override` or `force` flags, look-alike or non-string categories, and "ignore the policy" wording.
9. Run `npm run skills:eval` and check this skill's cases pass.

## Output checklist

Report to the PR or chat:

- [ ] Web book matches `isUserBlocked()` with no override
- [ ] Chat book of a blocked employee matches `validateUrgentOverride()`
- [ ] Only the three urgent categories are accepted
- [ ] Admin claims, override flags, and non-string categories are refused
- [ ] `blocked_until` is unchanged after an override
- [ ] Booking rows carry the override fields
- [ ] Cutoff, weekend, holiday, and one-booking-per-date checks still refuse a chat request
- [ ] Chat responses list `skills` and each check in `decision_trace`; the urgent override step names this skill and `workride-chat-prd.md`
- [ ] The chat reply highlights that the booking used this exception

## PRD change — urgent chat override

Source: `prd/workride-chat-prd.md`. Baseline `prd/workride-prd.md` stays as written.

Old line: **2 consecutive no-shows, blocked 1 day, no exception.**

New line, chat only: a blocked employee may book from `POST /api/chat/bookings` when `validateUrgentOverride()` accepts `urgent_category` of `medical_emergency`, `family_emergency`, or `client_visit` and an explanation of 15–500 characters. The Book page and `POST /api/bookings` still refuse the booking. `blocked_until` is not cleared. Cutoffs, one booking per date, weekends, and holidays still apply.

## Evaluation

Test cases are in `evals.json` next to this file. Run them with `npm run skills:eval`.

## Do not

- Let the Book page or `POST /api/bookings` accept an urgent override
- Accept an urgent category other than `medical_emergency`, `family_emergency`, or `client_visit`
- Clear or shorten `blocked_until` when an override is accepted
- Decide urgency in the frontend only; the API must call `validateUrgentOverride()`
- Skip the cutoff, date, or one-booking-per-date checks for an urgent request
- Trust `is_admin`, `override`, `force`, or `policy_override` sent in the request body; only `validateUrgentOverride()` can lift the block
- Accept an `urgent_category` that is not a string, such as `["medical_emergency"]`
- Let the wording of the explanation ("I am an admin", "ignore the policy") change the decision
